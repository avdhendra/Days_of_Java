/**
 * Java is  Compiled/interpreted langauge where java script is interpreted langauge
 * Compiled vs Interpreted langauge
 

 Compiled:
 1. Code can be executed directed by computer cpu
 2.Code must be transformed into machine readable instructions
 3. Runs Faster
 4. Better Performance
ex: C++,Golang

 Interpreted:
 1.Another program executed Code
 2.No transformation needed
 3. slower
 4. Faster for development

ex:Javascript ,python

  /**Static Vs Dynamic Type Checking
   * The Process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types type checking may occurs either
   * at compile time (a static check) or at run-time(dynamic check)
   * 
   * 
   * Static Type checking
   * A langauge is statically typed if the type of variable is known at compile time instead of at runtime
   * Allows many type errors to be caught early in the development cycle
   * 
   * 
   * Dynamic Type Checking
   * is th process of verifying the type saftey of program at runtime
   * 
   * 
   * example of Complied 
   * 
   * for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
   * System.out.println(i);
   * }
   * String brand="AmigosCode" ----> here if i say int brand="AmigosCode" and execute the code
   * The whole code wont run because all error check in at compiled time and then execute the code 
   * 
   * 
   * 
   * while in javascript
   * for(var i=0;i<10;i++){
   * console.log(i);
   * }
   * fo
   * var i=10
   * if i run this program then the code will showing error at fo but above code is executed until for loop
